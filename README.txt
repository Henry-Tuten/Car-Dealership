Java Version 8

The main instructions are for the user interaction with the command pattern. During this phase, when it asks you for a command, just type in one of the numbers 1-8 to do
the associated command. For the GetInventoryDetails() and BuyItem() commands, you will have to give the program a string of the name of the item that you want to 
get more information from / buy. For example, you would enter Limo_14, Car_2, ElectricCar_6 as the name based on what is listed in the current inventory. Example output
of this is included in the simResults.txt on day 31 before closing.
